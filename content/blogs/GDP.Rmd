At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised

## Manual calculation of GDP

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.


> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

```{r}

# select only the required components of GDP
indicator_list2 <- c("Gross_capital_formation", "Exports", "Government_consumption", "Household_consumption", "Imports", "GDP_given")

# calculate overall GDP
calculated_GDP <- graph1_data %>%
  mutate(GDP = case_when(IndicatorName == "Imports" ~ -GDP, TRUE ~ GDP)) %>% 
  group_by(Country, Year) %>% 
  summarise(Yearly_GDP = sum(GDP))

# create wide format table and join calculated GDP
graph2_data <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% 
  filter(IndicatorName  %in% c(indicator_list2)) %>% 
  
  # switch to wide format to do calculations
  pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName, values_from = GDP) %>%
  mutate(Net_Exports = Exports - Imports) %>% 
  inner_join(calculated_GDP, by = c("Country", "Year")) %>% 
  mutate(abs_difference = Yearly_GDP - GDP_given) %>% 
  mutate(per_difference = (abs_difference/ GDP_given)*100)

# print difference between given GDP and calculated GDP
graph2_data %>% 
  select(c(Country, Year, per_difference)) %>% 
  kbl(col.names = c("Country", "Year", "% difference in GDP")) %>%
  kable_classic("striped") %>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T)

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

Generally speaking, the last chart gives us a percentage split for each component of the GDP. While the general tendency is similar across all three countries, we can observe some interesting dynamics.

Germany, as a very mature and highly developed country, does not show extreme changes within the GDP split and investments (Gross Capital Expenditure) are even decreasing. The strong export focus on exports is, however, clearly observable in terms of net exports which increased significantly over the past 20 years. Germany is today one of the leading exporting countries.

Looking at India, we can see that the country is developing very quickly with rapid shifts in terms of GDP components. The household spending has become a smaller part of the GDP while private investments almost doubled its share. National as well as international companies might have identified the enormous potential of India's rapidly growing population and invested correspondingly.

The United States stand out due to its growing share of household spending. An American population that gets increasingly wealthy might be a possible explanation. Furthermore, Americans are known for extensive spending, even on credit. Despite that, the country continues to be an attractive place for investments. 

End note: Due to COVID-19, all countries would now and in the coming years show a spike in government spending.
