<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My name is <strong>Muhammad <em>Nauman</em> Alam Khan</strong> and I was born and brought up in <strong>Paksitan</strong>, where I spent the first 16 years of my life. It was during my formative years that I was initially introduced to field hockey, a sport that I would go on to dedicate most of the next decade of my life to.</p>

<h3>Hockey</h3>
<p>I first played the sport casually at school before trying out for the school team, of which I became the captain of in my second year on the team. While competing in an inter-school tournament I was noticed by members of the <a href="https://pakhockey.org/">National Hockey Federation</a> and offered a place on the National Training Camp. I used to spend nearly 4 hours training alongside the Pakistan Olympic Squad, with the aim of one day joining their ranks.</p>
<p>This journey was brought to an abrupt stop after I suffered a severe injury to my right knee which damaged my ACL. However, this experience instilled in me the importance of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team work</li>
<li>Discipline</li>
<li>Dedication</li>
</ul>
<p>These qualities along with a strong capacity to perform under high pressure situations have guided my career decisions since.</p>
