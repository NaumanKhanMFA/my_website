      <description>Let us revisit the CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data. There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use vroom to load it and you keep cache=TRUE in the chunk options.
Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:
by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not# Clean Covid datacleaned_covid_data &amp;lt;- covid_data %&amp;gt;% filter(age_group !</description>

      <description>Climate change and temperature anomaliesIf we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here
To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.</description>

      <description>At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the Wikipedia GDP page.
The GDP data we will look at is from the United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today.</description>
