![Nauman Khan](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFsxWLDs3dwOw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0?e=1605139200&v=beta&t=szQjyl02QL5sPnsNABtnreMB2azCt9fYjacoUbGxN6U)

### Introduction

My name is **Muhammad *Nauman* Alam Khan** and I was born and brought up in **Paksitan**, where I spent the first 16 years of my life. It was during my formative years that I was initially introduced to field hockey, a sport that I would go on to dedicate most of the next decade of my life to. 

### Hockey

I first played the sport casually at school before trying out for the school team, of which I became the captain of in my second year on the team. While competing in an inter-school tournament I was noticed by members of the [National Hockey Federation](https://pakhockey.org/) and offered a place on the National Training Camp. I used to spend nearly 4 hours training alongside the Pakistan Olympic Squad, with the aim of one day joining their ranks.

This journey was brought to an abrupt stop after I suffered a severe injury to my right knee which damaged my ACL. However, this experience instilled in me  the importance of:

* Team work 
* Discipline 
* Dedication

These qualities along with a strong capacity to perform under high pressure situations have guided my career decisions since.

### Moving Countries
In 2013, I moved to Saudi Arabia with my family. I continued my education here, completing my A Levels before moving to Malaysia in 2015 to pursue my Undergraduate degree in Finance at the University of Nottingham.
