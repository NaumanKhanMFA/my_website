# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors
Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hypothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 


# 1. First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.
```{r,  fig.width=10, fig.height=6}

#Confidence interval creation
S_directors <- movies %>%
  select(director, rating) %>%
  filter(director == "Steven Spielberg" | director == "Tim Burton") %>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarize(avg = mean(rating), 
            sd = sd(rating), 
            count = n(),
            tstat = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se = sd/sqrt(count),
            
            lower_ci = avg - tstat*se, 
            upper_ci = avg + tstat*se) 
S_directors

#Data Visualization
ggplot(S_directors, aes(x = avg, y = reorder(director, avg), color = director)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = lower_ci, xmax = upper_ci), width = 0.1) +
  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same IMDB Ratings",
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap",
       x = "Mean IMDB Rating", y = "") +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(lower_ci,2)), vjust=-1.5,hjust=3,angle=0, color="black", size=7) +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(upper_ci,2)), vjust=-1.5,hjust=-2,angle=0, color="black", size=7) +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(avg,2)), vjust=-1, colour= "black", size= 11)+
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()+
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  annotate("rect", fill = "grey", alpha = 0.5, xmin=7.27, xmax= 7.33, ymin=-Inf, ymax = Inf)

```
# 2. In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

The null hypothesis: Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton Mean IMDB Ratings are the same
The alternative hypothesis: Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton Mean IMDB Ratings are not the same

```{r}
Null_testing <- movies %>%
  select(director, rating) %>%
  filter(director == "Steven Spielberg" | director == "Tim Burton")

t.test(rating ~ director, data =Null_testing)
```

The p-value is 0.01 which is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis. We assume that the Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton IMDB Ratings averageare not the same
