# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

2. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}

# initial data exploration
glimpse(weather)
skim(weather)

# select relevant data and transform to tidy format
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  select(c(Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:13, names_to="Month", values_to="Delta") 
tidyweather

```


## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}

# transformation of dataframe
tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(Date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         Month = month(Date, label=TRUE),
         Year = year(Date))

# create scatter ggplot 
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=Year, y = Delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Increasing temperature in recent years",
    subtitle = "Weather anomalies on a monthly basis"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a separate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap}

# create ggplot using facet_wrap by month
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=Year, y = Delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~Month)+
  labs (
    title = "Consistent increase in temperature across all months",
    subtitle = "Yearly change in temperature by month"
  )

```

It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. N0ASA calculates a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(Interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```


Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

# create density ggplot with filled according to interval variable
ggplot(comparison, aes(x=Delta, fill=Interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with transparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Recent interval emphazises trend of rising temperature changes",
    subtitle = "Density plot for monthly temperature anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year

  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(Delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Strong trend towards global warming within past 30 years",
    subtitle = "Average yearly temperature change",
    y     = "Average annual delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

# create 95% CI for the annual delta in temperature from 2011-present for each  
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(Interval == "2011-present") %>% # choose the interval 2011-present
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_aad = mean(Delta, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_aad = sd(Delta),
            count = n(),
            # get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_aad = sd(Delta)/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_aad,
            aad_low = mean_aad - margin_of_error,
            aad_high = mean_aad + margin_of_error)

# print out CI in table format
formula_ci %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("Year", "Mean delta", "SD delta", "Count", "T-Value", "SE", "Margin of error", "CI lower", "CI upper")) %>%
  kable_classic(c("hover"), html_font = "Cambria") %>%
  kable_styling()

```
```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula_update}

# create 95% CI for the annual delta in temperature from 2011-present 
formula_ci2 <- comparison %>% 
  filter(Interval == "2011-present") %>% # choose the interval 2011-present
  na.omit() %>% 
  summarise(mean_aad = mean(Delta),
            sd_aad = sd(Delta),
            count = n(),
            # get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_aad = sd_aad/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_aad,
            aad_low = mean_aad - margin_of_error,
            aad_high = mean_aad + margin_of_error)

# print out CI in table format

  kable_classic(c("hover"), html_font = "Cambria") %>%
  kable_styling()

```

```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
set.seed(1234)

boot_aad <- comparison %>%
  # Choose only  interval from 2011-present
  filter(Interval == "2011-present") %>%
  
  # Specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = Delta) %>%
  
  # Generate a bunch of bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  
  # Find the mean of each sample
  calculate(stat = "mean")

# create and print bootstrapped CI
percentile_ci <- boot_aad %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_ci

# visualize bootstrapped CI

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))

glimpse(gss)
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r}
social_media <- gss %>%
  mutate(snap_insta = if_else(snapchat == "NA" & instagrm == "NA", "NA", if_else(snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes", "Yes", "No")))

glimpse(social_media)
```

## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascneding order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 
1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?


## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.


# Trump's Approval Margins

**As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)**

```{r, cache=TRUE}

# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(file ="data/approval_polllist.csv")

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

```

## Create a plot

**What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.**

```{r trump_margins, out.width="100%"}

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist1 <- approval_polllist%>%

mutate (start_date = mdy(startdate), end_date = mdy(enddate),week = week(end_date), year = year(end_date), net = (approve - disapprove))

# calculate the CI
data1 <- approval_polllist1 %>%
  
  group_by(year, week) %>%
summarise (count= n(),avg_net=mean(net),
    sd = sd(net),
    se = sd/ sqrt(count),
    t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1 ),
    lower = avg_net - t_critical * se,
    upper = avg_net + t_critical * se) 

```


```{r trump_margins2, out.width="100%"}

# Visualise the CI
ggplot(data1, aes(x=week, y=avg_net, color=factor(year), fill=factor(year)))+
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower, ymax=upper, alpha=0.3), fill="white", guide = FALSE)+
  geom_line()+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,52,13))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-20,7.5,2.5))+
  guides(fill=F,color=F)+
  labs(
  title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve-disapprove) for Donald Trump", subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
       x= "Week of the year",
       y= "Average Net Approval (%)"
     )+
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0,color="orange"))
  NULL

```

**You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:**

```{r trump_margins3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

**Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.**         

*ANSWER:*        
     
The CI for week 15 is (-8.29,-6.948) and the CI for week 34 is (-13.03,-9.929). We can see the the confidence interval spreads out when it is closer to the Election Day. This shows that the average net approval becomes more uncertain, although it becomes more negative. The negative value of the net approval means higher disapproval than approval for Donald Trump in the total poll. And as it is closer to the Election Day, Donald Trump has become less popular with even higher disapproval rates. This might be because recent unwise measurements taken by Donald Trump against COVID have raised American citizens' concerns, which has brought larger uncertainty in terms of voting results.

# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful
1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful
1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.
1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.
1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?


# 5 Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.

```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>% # If vroom::vroom(url) doesn't work, use read_csv(url)
  clean_names()

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)
```
Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not

```{r, co-morbidities}

  # %>% filter(current_status != "Probable Case")


# Calculation Covid_comorbidities
covid_comorbidities <- cleaned_covid_data %>% 
  dplyr::count(age_group,sex,medcond_yn,death_yn) %>% 
  spread(key = death_yn, value = n) %>% 
 mutate(death_percentage = Yes/(Yes+No)) 

```

```{r, plot_comorbidities, fig.height = 8, fig.width=15}

```

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.

```{r}

# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE, echo = T, results = 'hide'}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

**ANSWER: The standard deviation is much higher in 2020 compared to 2019. In other words, at some days people rent a lot of bikes, while on other days they rent almost none and both szenarios are not so different in terms of occurence. This might be due to COVID and many changes in rules and regulation regarding work from home, lock down etc. **


## Templates

The challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```


The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```


## Reproduction of chart 1
